Git Bash

git init - make directory a repository
git init NAME - make new repository
notepad NAME - create file in directory
git add NAME - to start tracking the file with git
git commit - commits all added files to the repository as a change
	can add a message to go with the commit
	-a flag commits all changes to all tracked files, without it you can add files individually and be more precise with your commits
	-m flag allows you to specify a commit message directly on the command line instead of in your default editor
git status - shows the current status of the git repository, including untracked files and uncommitted changes
git log - shows us a chronological log of all of our commits to the current repository
git checkout COMMIT_IDENTIFIER - check out a different version of the code from the one you're currently looking at
git checkout master - checkout master
git diff COMMIT_IDENTIFIER1 COMMIT_IDENTIFIER2 - compare versions of project


Branching
	master is the default branch in any new repository, usually the version deployed in production
	when you create a branch it will start with the code from whatever branch you were in at the time, this is why it is often a good idea to switch to master

	git branch BRANCH_NAME - create a new branch named BRANCH_NAME
	git checkout BRANCH_NAME - switch branches
	git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME - create a new branch named BRANCH_NAME and switch to that branch
	git branch - lists all branches and denotes the one you are on with an asterisk
	git branch -D BRANCH_NAME - deletes a branch (can't be the one you are currently on)
	
Merging
	git merge BRANCH_NAME - merge branch into current branch
		often done while in master
	resolving conflicts
		get conflict on merge
		edit files manually (shown with conflict markup)
		add file to staging area
		git commit
			git knows we are resolving a merge conflict
			add any messages we think are needed
		Merged!
	
Working With Remote Repositories
	Cloning - creating a copy of a repository on your computer
		Merge different copies of the same repository
			pushing changes to from local copy to remote 
			pulling changes from remote to local copy
	git clone NETWORK_ADDRESS/REMOTE_REPO NAME - clones repository and gives it a NAME
		sets up NETWORK_ADDRESS/REMOTE_REPO NAME as a remote repository
	git remote - lists all remote repositories associated with the current repository
		origin is the one you cloned from
	git remote add NAME PATH - add a new remote repository to the current repository
	
	Push & Pull
		git push REPOSITORY BRANCH
			first argument is remote, if not provided chooses origin
				necessary to explicitly say remote for pushing new branches that do not exist in the origin
		git pull  REPOSITORY BRANCH
		

Gitflow is helpful for managing projects that make heavy use of feature branching
