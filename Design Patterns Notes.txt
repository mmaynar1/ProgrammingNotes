Design Patterns

Strategy
	Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it
	Works well with Spring Framework
	The Duck example in Head First Design Patterns
	Encapsulate what varies
	Favor composition over inheritance
	Program to interfaces, not implementations
	When inheritance doesn't quite make sense, instead use an interface that child classes can implement for using the methods that don't make sense
	
Immutable
	Locking down a piece of data
	Creating an immutable object instance that cannot be changed by any code
	Good for defensive programming
	Make the class final
	Make all fields final and private
	If instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed
		Create a new one inside the object
	No setters, private class variable, must instantiate through constructor
	Enums are mutable out of the box, and can be made immutable
	Used in POJOs
	
Observer
	Defines a many-to-one dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically
	Like a subscription to a newspaper/magazine
		publisher = subject
		subscribers = observers
	When data in subject changes, observers are notified
	Subject interface
	    concrete subject(s) implement it
		has-a observer interface
	Observer interface
		concrete observer(s) implement it
	Concrete observers
		register with a concrete subject	
	Subjects and observers are loosely coupled
	The only thing the subject knows about an observer is that it implements a certain interface (the Observer interface)
	Can add new observers at any time
	Never need to modify the subject to add new types of observers
	Changes to an observer or subject will not affect the other
	In Java:
		Extend the Observable class
		Can be helpful, but also has pitfalls. Can only extend Observable, can't implement as an interface
	It is good to be able to make your own implementation
	Examples in the JDK
		Observer/Observable
		Swing JButton
		JavaBeans PropertyChangeListener
	Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
	
MVC
	components communicate through clearly defined interfaces
	components shouldn't know/care about how the others are implemented
	Model - what to display
	View - how it's displayed
	Controller - formatting the model for display and handling events like user input
